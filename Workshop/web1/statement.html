	<p> Statement<br><br>“Wonderland” is an eerie, Alice in Wonderland inspired mini website. It guides the user into different optical illusion like experiences throughout each page. 
My website could be interpreted in many different ways, but my personal intention of my website was focused on the topic of anxiety, and more specifically, social anxiety. Each page allows the user to first-hand experience what a person with anxiety may feel like; at least in a visual manner. The pages are designed to make the user feel uncomfortable; for example, dozens of foreign eyes staring at them, a jail cell closing, and uncontrollable sound waves (the circles).
The primary tool in my website is the long vertical scroll. It acts as a “movement” tool as my backgrounds are designed to appear to be moving around as the user scrolls through the page. The “narrator” in my website says things like “where am i?” or “I wanna go home”, as if they are lost in a wonderland – thus emphasizing the “location” theme.
All images were made in illustrator then imported to photoshop for editing. Any moving object or fading animations are functioning through webkit- a web browser rendering engine that allows simple animations without javascipt or jquery.
One unique function about my website is the resizing limitations. When sized too small, the elements on the page may get cluttered or the user won’t be able to feel the full experience of the website. Thus, I added a limit to how small the user could resize it.</p>
